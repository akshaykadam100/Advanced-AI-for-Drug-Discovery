## Anatomy of Genome Sequencing

Genome sequencing is the process of analysing an individual's DNA to learn about its properties

DNA is composed of 4 bases
- Adenine
- Guanine
- Thymine
- Cytosine


Part A:
- How many letters are in each sequence? Find the length of the sequence in each row and store the results in new column called `Length`
- Then, find the median length of these genome sequences and store it in a variable called `median_len`
- Delete all rows that are not of this length (`median_len`)


Part B
- Create a new column `Match?` (consisting of value as 1 or 0). Will check whether any of the sequences contains substring as `TAATTTAGGCATGCCTT`
 

Part C
- Create a matrix called `differences` storing the number of differences in the sequences between rows. 
    - For Example, if row 6 differs from row 8 by two mutations both (6,8) and (8,6) in the 2D array should result with the number two. One way to do this is by creating a function that gets the differences between two sequences.


Part D
- Find the 2 genome sequences that are most similar. Store them in a tuple called `similar` with the format (row_1, row_2)
